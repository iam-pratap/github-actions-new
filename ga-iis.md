Hereâ€™s a simple GitHub Actions workflow that does the following:

Creates a directory (build)

Copies the directory to an IIS server via SCP

Requirements:
The IIS server must have OpenSSH installed and configured.

You should store the server credentials as GitHub Secrets:

IIS_HOST: The IIS server IP or hostname.

IIS_USER: The SSH user with write access to the IIS directory.

IIS_PASSWORD: The SSH password (or use an SSH key).

IIS_TARGET_DIR: The target directory on the IIS server.

Edit
name: Deploy to IIS Server

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Run only when pushing to the main branch

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Create Directory and Add Files
        run: |
          mkdir -p build
          echo "Hello, IIS!" > build/index.html
          echo "Deployment Date: $(date)" >> build/index.html

      - name: Install SSH Client
        run: sudo apt-get install -y sshpass

      - name: Copy Files to IIS Server
        run: |
          sshpass -p "${{ secrets.IIS_PASSWORD }}" scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -r build/* ${{ secrets.IIS_USER }}@${{ secrets.IIS_HOST }}:${{ secrets.IIS_TARGET_DIR }}

      - name: Restart IIS Server (Optional)
        run: |
          sshpass -p "${{ secrets.IIS_PASSWORD }}" ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ${{ secrets.IIS_USER }}@${{ secrets.IIS_HOST }} "iisreset"
How It Works
Triggers on a push to main.

Creates a build directory and adds a sample index.html file.

Installs SSH client (sshpass) for password authentication.

Copies files using scp to the IIS server.

Optionally restarts IIS to apply changes.

This workflow ensures that new files are deployed to the IIS server whenever changes are pushed to the main branch. Let me know if you need adjustments! ðŸš€

Hereâ€™s an improved GitHub Actions workflow using the appleboy/ssh-action to copy files to an IIS server via SSH and restart IIS if needed.

Prerequisites
Set Up GitHub Secrets in your repository:

IIS_HOST â†’ The IIS serverâ€™s IP or domain

IIS_USER â†’ SSH username

IIS_PASSWORD â†’ SSH password (or use an SSH key instead)

IIS_TARGET_DIR â†’ The directory on the IIS server (e.g., C:/inetpub/wwwroot/myapp)

GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/deploy.yml)

Edit
name: Deploy to IIS Server

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Runs on push to the main branch

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Create Directory and Add Files
        run: |
          mkdir -p build
          echo "Hello, IIS!" > build/index.html
          echo "Deployment Date: $(date)" >> build/index.html

      - name: Deploy Files to IIS Server
        uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.4
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.IIS_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.IIS_USER }}
          password: ${{ secrets.IIS_PASSWORD }}
          source: "build/*"
          target: ${{ secrets.IIS_TARGET_DIR }}
          overwrite: true

      - name: Restart IIS Server
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1.0.3
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.IIS_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.IIS_USER }}
          password: ${{ secrets.IIS_PASSWORD }}
          script: |
            iisreset
How This Works
Triggers on a push to main.

Creates a build directory and adds a sample index.html file.

Uses appleboy/scp-action to copy files to the IIS server.

Uses appleboy/ssh-action to restart IIS after deployment.

Benefits of This Approach
âœ… Uses appleboy/ssh-action instead of sshpass (cleaner & more secure).
âœ… Automates IIS deployments with a single push.
âœ… Ensures files are deployed correctly and IIS is restarted.

This should work perfectly for deploying your files to an IIS server. Let me know if you need modifications! ðŸš€
